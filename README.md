### Design and Goals of SafeLINC

SafeLINC is a mobile app designed to be an interface between at-risk youth, their therapist and optionally, their parents.

The functionality of SafeLINC is based on the proven clinical intervention for suicidal youths called a Safety Plan. A Safety Plan is a collaborative document where the youth and their therapist work together to identify potential triggers to avoid, coping mechanisms for dealing with triggers and ideation, social networks for external support, and ways to reduce access to dangerous materials/items.

SafeLINC takes what was a static document and brings it to a digital medium that allows for changes in the youth's Plan and reacts to the youth's input and needs.

The core feature of SafeLINC is the daily Check In, which is designed to encourage daily interaction with the youth's Safety Plan. During a daily Check In, youths can log any major life events that have caused them mental distress today, stressors that they enocuntered today, and strategies that they used to manage stress today. The information from the youth's daily Check In can be shared with their therapist or parents if they wish, allowing for a therapist to keep track of their client's wellbeing in between sessions, and is charted over time to help identify trends in the youth's mental health.

### My Contributions to SafeLINC

My technical contributions to SafeLINC were as a Full Stack Software Engineer.

The majority of my Backend contributions were in planning and architecting the project's cloud services hosted on AWS. Due to the highly restricted nature of our user's data we had to ensure our infrastructure was HIPAA compliant, which required the planning process to be slow and careful, and makes it difficult to share the details in a public GitHub repo.

My contributions to SafeLINC's Frontend were focused on the functionality and user experience of the youth, or teen.

**What I have in this repository is a selection of code samples I wrote for the project's API and Frontend that should hopefully provide an overview of my contributions to this project, and my competencies as a Software Engineer.
